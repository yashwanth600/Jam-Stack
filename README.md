Bootstrap 5 UI Exploration & Page Design


Overview
This repository contains my submission for the Internship Task focused on exploring Bootstrap 5's UI components and designing responsive HTML pages by remixing them creatively. The project includes three pages: Home, About/Services, and Contact, built with Bootstrap 5 via CDN, minimal custom CSS, and Git/GitHub for version control and hosting.

Project Reflection
Step-by-Step Achievement

Set up Bootstrap 5 via CDN and created index.html, about.html, and contact.html.
Explored Bootstrap Examples, identified components (navbars, cards, hero sections, forms, modals), and collected them for remixing.
Designed pages: Home (navbar, hero, features, footer), About/Services, and Contact (with a working form).
Applied styling with Bootstrap utilities and custom CSS for consistency and responsiveness.
Hosted on GitHub Pages and submitted links.

Use of Tools and Resources
I used AI tools (e.g., Grok) for initial code suggestions and referenced Bootstrap documentation for component details. No full pages were copied; snippets were modified.
Challenges Faced and Solutions

Challenge: Ensuring mobile responsiveness for the hero section.

Solution: Used Bootstrap's responsive utilities and tested with dev tools.


Challenge: Making the contact form functional.

Solution: Integrated Formspree for email submission.


Challenge: Maintaining visual synergy.

Solution: Stuck to Bootstrap's theme, tweaking with custom CSS.



Learning Journey and Completion Process
I learned Bootstrap 5's component structure, remixing techniques, and mobile-first design. The process involved exploring docs, building iteratively, and refining layouts over 10 hours across 2 days.
Time Taken
Total time: 10 hours over 2 days (5 hours/day).
Guidelines Followed

Used Bootstrap 5 as the main framework.
Added custom HTML/CSS where needed.
Focused on clarity, polish, and modern design.
Kept code clean and well-indented.
